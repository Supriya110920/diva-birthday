  <h2>To Payal</h2>
  <p>

Happy Birthday to the most beautiful person Iâ€™ve ever met â€” inside and out. It still feels like yesterday when we first met at the gym. I never imagined that a simple meeting there would lead to something so special, something so real.
<br>
<br>
From my disastrous impression on our first date to all our long bitching about everyone ,your irritated expressions on my cringe dialogue, your 'what-ever' s, your long explanation about fashion, your very impressive patience, your 'amar khide peyeche' s and 'bhalo lagchena' s  â€” every single memory with you is precious to me. Youâ€™ve become more than just my girlfriend â€” youâ€™re my peace, my happiness, and my biggest blessing.
<br>
<br>
I know our journey hasnâ€™t always been perfect, but thatâ€™s what makes it beautiful.
<br>
<br>
On your birthday, I just want you to know how truly grateful I am for you. You make my world brighter, my heart fuller, and my life so much better just by being in it. I never miss a chance to irritate you because I love You, but I promise to always respect you.
<br>
<br>
May this day bring you all the love, joy, and warmth you bring into my life every single day. You deserve nothing less than the best, my Diva. 
<br>
<br>
Happy Birthday, my love
